        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.”

      On C++, I created a wordle programme that picks a word at random
      from a list of words and gives the user six attempts to guess the word<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
      As the user tries to guess the word, the application provides hints about
      the letters present in the word as well as the letters present in the correct position in the word.</span>
